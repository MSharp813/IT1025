# Data, Information and Knowledge

## Relational Data

Data is the raw bits and pieces of information without context, information is the summarization of data, and knowledge is the possession of information or the ability to quickly locate it.
Personal customer IDs. 
The orders table would be dependent on the customers table.
Customer ID
It is important to properly define the data type of a field because if a field should only store a whole number, declaring it as an INTEGER prevents you from writing some arbitrary nonsensical string into it.

## Big Data

The four Vs of Big Data are volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. Volume represents the amount of data and is one of the main characteristics that makes data “big”. Velocity represents the motion of the data. Variety defines different types of data and data resources. Veracity can be termed as the trustworthiness of the data.
Banks across the world that has used Big Data technology to ensure customer loyalty, cricket websites like ESPN and Cricbuzz that has been able to predict how the bowler will bowl or what kind of shot a batsman will play, and Retail and E-commerce industries using Big Data for the prediction of product demands, for analyzing consumer behavior patterns etc. drives the need for increased Big Data.

# Structured Query Language

A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational mode. The purpose of SQL is to access and manipulate databases.     
The primary key for the employees and orders table is the EmployeeID. The foreign keys are OrderID, CustomerID, and EmployeeID. The meaning of the relationship between the tables is the fact that orders is the step after employees.
A successful SQL injection attack can result in confidential data being deleted, lost or stolen; websites being defaced; unauthorized access to systems or accounts and, ultimately, compromise of individual machines or entire networks. To prevent SQL injection you should use input validation, not construct queries with user input, Update and patch often, use firewalls, etc.
