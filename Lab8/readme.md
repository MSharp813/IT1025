# Executive Summary

In Lab 8 we learned about data, information, knowledge, structured query language(SQL), and ethical and legal implications. We went in depth about relational data, big data, the code of ethics, intellectual property, and information collection.

# Data, Information and Knowledge

## Relational Data

Data is the raw bits and pieces of information without context, information is the summarization of data, and knowledge is the possession of information or the ability to quickly locate it.
Personal customer IDs. 
The orders table would be dependent on the customers table.
Customer ID
It is important to properly define the data type of a field because if a field should only store a whole number, declaring it as an INTEGER prevents you from writing some arbitrary nonsensical string into it.

## Big Data

The four Vs of Big Data are volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. Volume represents the amount of data and is one of the main characteristics that makes data “big”. Velocity represents the motion of the data. Variety defines different types of data and data resources. Veracity can be termed as the trustworthiness of the data.
Banks across the world that has used Big Data technology to ensure customer loyalty, cricket websites like ESPN and Cricbuzz that has been able to predict how the bowler will bowl or what kind of shot a batsman will play, and Retail and E-commerce industries using Big Data for the prediction of product demands, for analyzing consumer behavior patterns etc. drives the need for increased Big Data.

# Structured Query Language

A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational mode. The purpose of SQL is to access and manipulate databases.     
The primary key for the employees and orders table is the EmployeeID. The foreign keys are OrderID, CustomerID, and EmployeeID. The meaning of the relationship between the tables is the fact that orders is the step after employees.
A successful SQL injection attack can result in confidential data being deleted, lost or stolen; websites being defaced; unauthorized access to systems or accounts and, ultimately, compromise of individual machines or entire networks. To prevent SQL injection you should use input validation, not construct queries with user input, Update and patch often, use firewalls, etc.


# Ethical and Legal Implications

## Code of Ethics

The purpose of the code of ethics is to outline a set of acceptable behaviors for a professional or social group. The ACM created a code of ethics to set a guideline for what people can and can't do. 
A code of ethics is broad, giving employees or members a general idea of what types of behavior and decisions are acceptable and encouraged at a business or organization. An acceptable use policy is more focused.

 ## Intellectual Property
 
The purpose of the WIPO is to lead the development of a balanced and effective international IP system that enables innovation and creativity for the benefit of all. This also makes it important.
You can get a copyright by registering a copyright with the U.S. Copyright Office. Copyright provides the creator of an original work, such as a piece of music or a song, with exclusive rights to it. The benefits of copyright provides the creator of an original work, such as a piece of music or a song, with exclusive rights to it. It is important to put a copyright on my svg image so no one other than me could use it.
The trademark would symbolize your intellectual property.

## Information Collection

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 is a United States federal law effective April 21, 2000 that applies to the online collection of personal information by persons or entities under U.S. jurisdiction about children under 13 years of age.
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 is a United States federal law that governs the access to educational information and records by public entities such as potential employers, publicly funded educational institutions, and foreign governments.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 was enacted by the 104th United States Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996.

# Conclusion

In Lab 8 we learned about data, information, knowledge, structured query language(SQL), and ethical and legal implications.
