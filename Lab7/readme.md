# Executive Summary

This lab learned about file compression, object oriented programming, and unified modeling language. During this lab we compressed files, programmed using object oriented programming in python idle, and used unified modeling language.

# File Compression

File compression is used to make an original file smaller. The purpose of file compression is to use less desk space. 

The SVG graphic file size is 82.7 KB. The compressed file file size is 18.9 KB. If the file was a jpg file instead of a svg one the file size would be smaller. This is because jpg uses lossy compression while svg is lossless.

# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

The methods of the shark class is swimming and being awesome. 
The purpose of the constructor is to use to initialize data.
A class is like a blueprint or a prototype that you can define to use to create objects while an object is an instance of a class. This is the realized version of the class, where the class is manifested in the program. To instantiate an object from a class is to create an instance of an object in an object-oriented programming (OOP) language.

 
# Unified Modeling Language (UML)

OMG or Object Management Group is a not-for-profit computer industry specifications consortium whose members define and maintain the UML specification.
The purpose of UML is to specify, construct, and document the artifacts of systems.

class = shark; because in the shark program, shark was the blue print of the object.
object = Sammy; because in the shark program, sammy represented a basic building block.
inheritence = swim(self); because in the shark program, swim(self) was used to make a new class from an existing one.
abstraction = a specific type of shark;
encapsulation = definition of a shark; 

# Conclusion

This lab learned about file compression, object oriented programming, and unified modeling language.
