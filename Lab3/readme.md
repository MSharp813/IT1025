# Executive Summary

# Software
     
Operating systems manage the hardware and create the interface between the hardware and the user. An example of an operating system is Android. Application software is the category of programs that do something useful for the user. An example of application softtware is Google Chrome. Utility software includes software that allows you to fix or modify your computer in some way. Antivirus software is an example of utility software.

The purpose of the ERP system is to utilize a central database that is implemented throughout the entire organization as a software application.

The purpose of virtualization is to manage workloads by radically transforming traditional computing to make it more scalable. The difference between virtualization and cloud computing is the fact that virtualization is software that makes computing environments independent of physical infrastructure, while cloud computing is a service that delivers shared computing resources on demand via the Internet.

# Visualization

The problems that were solved with vrtualzation of companies could partition their servers and run legacy apps on multiple operating system types and versions. hypervisors separate the physical resources from the virtual environments.

# Python

Pseudocode is an informal way of programming description that does not require any strict programming language syntax or underlying technology. Python being a simple and minimalistic language gives it a pseudo-code nature. 

A program written in a compiled language  is converted from the source language into a language that is spoken by your computer using a compiler with various flags and options. An interpreted language, like Python, is any programming language that isn't already in "machine code" prior to runtime.

# Career Exploration

After I went to the Bureau of Labor Statistics I found out that the career path that I wanted to go down would be that of a software developer. Software developers are the creative minds behind computer programs. Some 
develop the applications that allow people to do specific tasks on a computer or 
another device. Others develop the underlying systems that run the devices or that 
control networks.

## Certifications

CySA+ is the only intermediate high-stakes cybersecurity analyst certification with performance-based questions covering security analytics, intrusion detection and response. The behavioral analytics skills covered by CySA+ identify and combat malware, and advanced persistent threats (APTs), resulting in enhanced threat visibility across a broad attack surface. 

CompTIA CySA+ is for IT professionals looking to gain security analyst skills including performing data analysis and interpreting the results to identify vulnerabilities, threats and risks to an organization. Configure and use threat-detection tools. Secure and protect applications and systems within an organization.

## Certificates

The certificate that I would be most interested in would be the post-degree professional certificate in programming and development. Post-graduate certificate in programming and development is designed to update or enhance skills in programming and development. Students who aim to get the certificate would experience the object-oriented environment of programming and development.

##  Co-ops / Internships

To be co-op ready a student has to be currently enrolled at Cuyahoga Community College, completed 12 credit hours of college coursework with at least two courses related to your major field, have a GPA of 2.75 or higher, complete the "Co-op Student Application of Interest" form and submit to the Career Center, participate in the co-op orientation process through the Career Center, upload your resume for final revisions and approval by a Career Coach at College Central Network, and complete and sign a "Cooperative Education Agreement" form.
A co-op opportunity is beneficial because gives students an edge by providing them with hands-on learning experience through job assignments related to their field. Not only is a job assignment vital to a studentâ€™s marketability, but it allows you to use what is learned in the classroom. Real world experience provides insight to career paths and job opportunities. In addition to being compensated, as in a regular work assignment, the student can earn one college credit for each 180 hours worked, up to three credits per semester.

## Industry Associations / Student Organizations

The club that I picked was the Information Technology Career Advancement Club (ITCAC). The purpose of this club is to help achieve future careers in the Information Technology field. This club would be beneficial because it would help get a future career in the IT field.

The mission of the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) system is a competitive environment that challenges student's in depth understanding of managing the challenges inherent in protecting a corporate network infrastructure and business information systems.

ACM-W supports, celebrates, and advocates internationally for the full engagement of women in all aspects of the computing field, providing a wide range of programs and services to ACM members and working in the larger community to advance the contributions of technical women.

IEEE's core purpose is to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity.
