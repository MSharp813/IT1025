# Executive Summary 

Lab 1 was meant to show how IT1025 course is suppose to work, set up GitHub, and explain information systems for business and beyond. Within GitHub, we use basic writing and formatting syntax using the “markdown” language. 

# Information System Components
*PlayStation* **Hardware** -  a specialized mid-range gaming PC.

# GitHub

## Client - Server Architecture
Client - Server Architecture is a computing model in which the server hosts, delivers and manages most of the resources and services to be consumed by the client. GitHub desktop allows the client - server architecture to be more efficient as multiple people can help collaborate easily.

## Cloud Computing
GitHub is considered cloud computing because it hosts the resources we use to develop code. iMovie and GarageBand are examples of cloud computing because they also allow access to resources for clients to use.

# Conclusion

Overall from Lab 1 I learned how to use GitHub, and how this course is going to work.
