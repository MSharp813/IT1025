# Executive Summary

Software engineers design, develop, and test software and applications for computers.  

# Project

I did my research project on software developers, who they are and what they do. I have also, as required, uploaded my resume that I have made.

# Conclusion

I have overall really enjoyed this class. I have learned a lot from this class that I will take with in my future. Honestly, I wrote this research paper because I have considered myself about being a software developer in the future. My goal is still the same as when I started this class, to get my associate's degree while I graduate from high school.
