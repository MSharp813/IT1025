# Executive Summary

# Python IDLE

The differences between the Interactive Shell and the File Editor are that the Interactive Shell runs code one instruction at a time and the File Editor is where you write entire programs. 

## Code Examples
 
Variable: ex. - igloo ; a variable is where you can store a single value in a computer's memory
 
Assignment Statement: ex. - igloo = 89; You store values in variables with an assignment statement. An assignment statement has a variable name, an equal sign (which is referred to as an assignment operator), and the value to be stored.

Function: ex. - print() function; The print() and input() functions handle simple text output (to the screen) and input (from the keyboard). The len() function takes a string and evaluates to an int of the number of characters in the string. The str(), int(), and float() functions will evaluate to the string, integer, or floating-point number form of the value they are passed.

The three data types are integers, floating-point numbers, and strings

# Graphics

## Raster vs. Vector Graphics

Raster images are made of thousands or millions of tiny pixels so when you enlarge these images become more pixalatedand lose quality. Vector graphics don't lose quality no matter how much you zoom in. Vector graphics should be mainly used in a professional design setting, and other times raster images are okay.

## Lossless vs. Lossy Compression

It matters to developers that they use lossless or lossy compression because lossless keeps all data of the image but uses up more space while lossy losses some of the data but takes up less storage.

## File Formats

gif, jpeg, and png similarites and differences:
GIF allows for animated images unlike the others. JPEG uses lossy compression whild PNG uses lossless.

## File Properties

The image is suppose to be two diamonds/rhombuses that also has a M in between them. There were four layers required to make this image.
