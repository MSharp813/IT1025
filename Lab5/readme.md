# Lucidchart

I liked using the Lucidchart. It helps in the planning phase of making a website.Those who are plnning to  make a website could use this to help them.

# Introduction to Networking

## Data Transmission

Packet, Packet-Switching, IP Address, DNS, Protocol
Packet: Unit of data When a device intends to send a message to another device it breaks the message down into smaller pieces, called packets.
Packet-Switching: Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination addres
IP Address: Unique identifying number
DNS: (domain name system) Directory of IP address common names.  For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.comacts as the directory on the Internet. When a request to access a device with a domain name is given, a DNS server is queried. It returns the IP address of the device requested, allowing for proper routing.
Protocol: Set of rules to allow devices to communicate 

## Networking Hardware

Both devices, the switch and the hub have multiple ports that accepts Ethernet connections from Network Devices, but unlike a hub a switch is intelligent a switch it learns the physical addresses of the devices that are connected to it and stores these physical addresses called Mac addresses in its table. So when a data packet is sent to a switch. It's only directed to the intended destination port.
The benefits of routers over hubs and switches is that it can receive data outside of a local connection.

## Network Topologies

Single point failure is when a central hub or a switch failing that causes all computers on that central point to be affected, and will cause the whole network to go down. Star and ring topologies suffer from a single point failure.
Infrastructure topology has a combination of wired and wireless connections and a wireless mesh topology has only a wireless connection. I believe infrastructure is better because there is a wired and wireless connection.

## Network Design

I designed my network like a infrastructure topology. The router has a wired connection between the two computers and the printer and a wireless connection with the wireless access point.
