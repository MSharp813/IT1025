## IP Protocol

IP addresses or Internet Protocol addressess are the numbers assigned to computer network interfaces.
The difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is how they are written. IPv4 addresses are written as a string of four numbers between 0 and 255, separated by dots. A typical IPv4 address looks like this: 192.0.2.53. IPv6 addresses are considerably longer strings of numbers, so they are written using hexadecimals, which can fit more information into fewer digits. Colons separate the segments of IPv6 addresses instead of dots; for example, 2001:0db8::53.

ICANN is a non-profit public-benefit corporation with participants from all over the world dedicated to keeping the Internet secure, stable and interoperable.

## TCP/IP

TCP/IP defines the details of how data is sent and received through network adapters, hubs, switches, routers and other network communications hardware.
The “Client” in a TCP/IP connection is the computer or device that “dials the phone” and the “Server” is the computer that is “listening” for calls to come in.
Layers are important to changing technology because layers can be changed without affecting the other layers.
TELNET, FTP, TFTP, NFS, SMTP, LPD, X window, and SNMP run on the application layer.

## Internet Security 

HTTP or hypertext transfer protocol is the protocol that is used for viewing web pages. The server accepts and receives request (and continues to listen) from the client. 
Secure hypertext transfer protocol encrypts data that is being retrieved by HTTP to protect data.
