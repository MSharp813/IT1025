## IP Protocol

IP addresses or Internet Protocol addressess are the numbers assigned to computer network interfaces.
The difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is how they are written. IPv4 addresses are written as a string of four numbers between 0 and 255, separated by dots. A typical IPv4 address looks like this: 192.0.2.53. IPv6 addresses are considerably longer strings of numbers, so they are written using hexadecimals, which can fit more information into fewer digits. Colons separate the segments of IPv6 addresses instead of dots; for example, 2001:0db8::53.
