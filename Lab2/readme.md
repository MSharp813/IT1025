## Hard Drives and Memory

The difference between latency and transfer rates in the performance of a hard drive is that latency is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head, after the amount of time it takes a hard driveâ€™s read/write head to find the physical location of a piece of data on the disk while transfer rates are the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk media.

A solid state drive uses solid state memory to store data. A solid state drive not a disk but is referred to as a solid state disk drive, or a solid state disk because in some ways it replaces the traditional hard disk drive. The solid state dribe is different than a hard drive as it has no moving parts, no spinning platters, and no moving heads. 

Increasing RAM makes a computer run faster because more data can be loaded into the faster RAM without the need of constantly accessing the slower hard drive. The difference between 64 and 32 bit data paths is the number of bits transferred in 1 clock cycle. A 64 bit data path transfers 64 bits of at a time while a 32 bit data path transfers 32 bits at a time.

## ALU and the Control Unit

Explain the interaction of the control unit and ALU in the CPU 
The ALU has two inputs (Input A and Input B) from previous load instructions. The control unit gets an instruction from the RAM, and the control unit tells the ALU what operation to perform. The ALU performs the operation with the two inputs and produces an output. Sometimes, depending on the operation, the output of the ALU can be ignored. If the control unit tells the ALU to compare the two inputs the ALU uses flags to help the control unit decide what to do when it recieves the next instruction.

## CPU, Input & Output

You input the items into system by scannig them and input them onto your bill. The output is when you pay the money, and the money is taken out of your account and the groceries are taken out of their inventory and out the store. 

## Logic Gates and Circuits

A truth table shows the outputs from all possible combinations of inputs. A NAND gate is a Negated AND gate.The output of a NAND gate is true when one or more of its inputs are false. If all of a NAND gate's inputs are true then the output of the NAND gate is false. NAND truth table is the exact opposite of AND truth table.

## IEEE
the importance of ethics in device desig
IEEE's purpose is to foster technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity. It is important to have ethics in device design because they affect accountability, value alignment, explainability, fairness, and user data rights.

# Data Representation

Binary numbers are only made of 0's and 1's, and the radix for each digit or value is a power of two. Decimal numbers range from 0-9, and have a radix of a power of ten for each digit or value. Hexadecimal uses 0-9 and the letters A-F, and the radix for each digit or value is also two.
